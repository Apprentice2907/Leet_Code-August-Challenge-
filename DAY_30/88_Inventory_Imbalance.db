store_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row contains information about a store and its location.
Table: inventory

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| inventory_id| int     |

| quantity    | int     |
| price       | decimal |
+-------------+---------+
inventory_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row represents the inventory of a specific product at a specific store.
Write a solution to find stores that have inventory imbalance - stores where the most expensive product has lower stock than the cheapest product.

For each store, identify the most expensive product (highest price) and its quantity
For each store, identify the cheapest product (lowest price) and its quantity
A store has inventory imbalance if the most expensive product's quantity is less than the cheapest product's quantity
Calculate the imbalance ratio as (cheapest_quantity / most_expensive_quantity)
Round the imbalance ratio to 2 decimal places
Only include stores that have at least 3 different products
Return the result table ordered by imbalance ratio in descending order, then by store name in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Explanation:

Downtown Tech (store_id = 1):
Most expensive product: Laptop ($999.99) with quantity 5
Cheapest product: Mouse ($19.99) with quantity 50
Inventory imbalance: 5 < 50 (expensive product has lower stock)
Imbalance ratio: 50 / 5 = 10.00
Has 4 products (≥ 3), so qualifies
Suburb Mall (store_id = 2):
Most expensive product: Phone ($699.99) with quantity 3
Cheapest product: Case ($15.99) with quantity 75
Inventory imbalance: 3 < 75 (expensive product has lower stock)
Imbalance ratio: 75 / 3 = 25.00
Has 4 products (≥ 3), so qualifies
City Center (store_id = 3):
Most expensive product: Tablet ($499.99) with quantity 2
Cheapest product: Stylus ($29.99) with quantity 80
Inventory imbalance: 2 < 80 (expensive product has lower stock)
Imbalance ratio: 80 / 2 = 40.00
Has 3 products (≥ 3), so qualifies
Stores not included:
Corner Shop (store_id = 4): Only has 2 products (Watch, Band) - doesn't meet minimum 3 products requirement
Plaza Store (store_id = 5): Only has 2 products (Camera, Lens) - doesn't meet minimum 3 products requirement
The Results table is ordered by imbalance ratio in descending order, then by store name in ascending order
